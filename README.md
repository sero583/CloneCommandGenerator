# CloneCommandGenerator

## What is this?
This utility terminal program will generate clone commands in a specified range for each block, so you can copy-paste it into your server terminal and don't have to write it manually. 

## Why dont use /fill or other commands?
I did not find any other suitable command as a solution, so I just came up programming this small but powerful tool. I wanted to build with bubble columns an invisible elevator and however /fill didn't allow me to do what I wanted to do actually. So I came up doing it with dispensers and glass blocks (you can use any block, glass is just nicer in my opinion; so water doesn't flows in mass all around the world). Since /fill didn't allow (atleast on Bedrock Edition) good ways to add NBT I couldn't even fill the dispenser with buckets already, thats why the clone command came pretty handy.

## Why do I even share this?
My intention is to share it and help fellow people who are in the same situation as me and need something like this. I hope you like it and it's useful for you. I didn't implement any GUI since this would be overkill for such a small tool.
